Abstraction hides the implementation and shows the interface to a user

abstraction should be imported from ABC 

libraries implantable are ABC, abstract method 

Abstraction only can happen if there is at least one abstract method which is used by denoter @abstractmethod

child class inherit the properties from a base class in which the abstract method is converted into the concrete method 

abstract method - does not consist of anything empty
concrete method - contains code in it 

we cannot make the object of the abstract class but can make the object of the child class 

Encapsulation :

it consists of access modifiers: public, private, protected 

private is recognised if the variables consist of 2 underscores, It can be accessed only under the class 
protected is recognised if the variable consists of 1 underscore, It can be accessed under the derived class

Inheritance :

super() method used to access the variables of the base class
base class cannot access the child class properties but child class can access the properties of base class and it's properties
