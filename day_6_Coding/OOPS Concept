Abstraction hides the implementation and shows the interface to a user

abstraction should be imported from ABC 

libraries implantable are ABC, abstract method 

Abstraction only can happen if there is at least one abstract method which is used by denoter @abstractmethod

child class inherit the properties from a base class in which the abstract method is converted into the concrete method 

abstract method - does not consist of anything empty
concrete method - contains code in it 

we cannot make the object of the abstract class but can make the object of child class
